Python scripts

# Sara Linse
I was trained in Fortran77 and slowly learning Python, so my code may look old-school, but it works.
#
# Early programming activities for MD simultaions
My record in programming started with a summer project with Sven Engström, Lund Univeristy, in 1984, in which I wrote code for MD-simulations.
I modified the inner time-step loop to test different algorithms for calculating where to move each atom
depending on the locaton of all oter atoms and the resultig forces.
This was back in the days when Lund Univeristy had one (yes 1) computer and you had to submit you
jobs in a queue for excecution over night.
# Non-linear curve fitting 
I have also written code for non-linear curve fitting used to study ligand binding to proteins, which enabled the
positive cooperativity of Ca2+ binding to S100G (doi: 10.1021/bi00395a023; doi: 10.1038/335651a0) 
and calmodulin (https://doi.org/10.1016/S0021-9258(18)92938-8) to be quantified.
# Homology searches
I have also written code for homology searches (doi: 10.1074/jbc.272.23.14658) and for studies of fluorescence depolarization, also called homo-FRET (doi.org/10.1021/ma00167a028) with Mike Fayer, Stanford, in 1984.
# Protein folding and amyloid formation
Together wih Björn Linse, we produced Monte Carlo simulation programs for protein folding
showing that the Levinthal Paradox can be resolved through kinetic discrimination (doi: 10.1021/ja070386e) 
and peptide self-assemly in amyloid formation (doi: 10.1039/c0mb00321b; doi: 10.1021/jacs.5b07849).
In this case all code was written by Björn. Björn Linse is very active on GitHub (https://github.com/bfredl).
# Data analysis in science 
Nowadays I mainly write Python Scripts for data anlysis including the analysis of SPR data. 
# Contact Diagrams
The first Python Script that I have posted here on Github produces Contact Diagrams (PDBfilte_to_contactplot.py).
Not very original of course, but this script allows he user to easily define the atom type investigated and the distance cutoff
as well as the number of cutoffs applied and the color for display.

# Data anlysis in sports
My contribution to sports include scripts that creat the team result list for Hedjakten
an orienteering event (https://eventor.orientering.se/Documents/Event/95774/1/Resultat-Lagt-vling)
and for Lunds Bästa Allroundlöpare - a combination of reulst from Lundaloppet and 
S:t Hans Extreme (https://she.lundsok.se/resultatfiler/Lunds_basta_allroundlopare_2023.pdf)
